# Thermostat easy as pie

Have you ever tried to learn how to program advanced thermostat? That is a nice challenge. When it's possible to solve virtually any problem with technology, the real problem is how to adjust this solution to the minds, expectations and habits of people that will use it. With this tutorial you will analyze a few design problems with different modern tools like thermostat and similar common interfaces. You will also try to use User Centered Design process combined with some workshop methods to create another Nest. 

### Authors

__Hubert Turbaj__ is co-founder and UX Director at EDISONDA – design and research studio. Cognitive psychologist by education, he is interested in how people of different skills and age use technology in changing contexts. On the daily basis he tries to make interfaces easier and more fun to operate by asking additional questions and investigating mental models. In the future he will design the control room of nuclear plant.

## Overview
 
Most of contemporary technology depends on interaction with people. The key element of successful devices is the way they meet needs of users. That means they should do something users need and do it in a way that is easy to understand and learn.

That’s where interaction design comes in. By interaction design we understand the process and tools for creating interactions and interfaces that are easy to use and that empowers users (making them happy at the same time).

We will try to learn the basics and a little bit more of interaction design approach. The example that is going to be used will be a thermostat. This kind of devices are often too complex and designed in a way that requires too much effort to learn. But the example of innovative Nest thermostat shows that it might be done in a simpler way. 

 
## Buttons & minds – introduction to interaction design
 
There are three main areas that should be taken into consideration when designing the device (or interface, service, almost anything): 

__Users – Who is going to use the device? __

(Is it a man, women or a child? How old is he or she? Is he or she familiar with technology? Motivated?)

__Tasks (and needs) - Why is the device being used?__

(Is it for fun or work? What kind of goal is user going to accomplish? Why? Is the task complex? Repetitive? Important? Potentially dangerous?)

__Context (and situation) – When and where does the interaction take place?__

(When the device is going to be used – inside or outside? Is the situation stressful? Is the device connected? What are the default parameters? Will user wear gloves? Is there a lot of sun? Is it noisy?)

  
The basic concepts that should be with us during whole workshop are the following:
 
- **Affordance** – as Wikipedia puts it “is a quality of an object, or an environment, which allows an individual to perform an action” – in other words, the shape, behavior or other feature that suggests how the element should be used e.g. physical button by its shape suggest pressing 
- **Control** – the way the devices state or parameter can be changed – control allows user to operate the device – it can be button, touch panel, knob, switch etc.
- **Ergonomy** – all the efforts and approach “intended to maximize productivity by reducing operator fatigue and discomfort” i.e. adjusting technology to our mental and physical capability
- **Feedback** – information about what is happening or what are the consequences of performed action - all interactions (turning device on/off, changing it’s state, changing parameters of the device etc.) should generate specific and understandable feedback – feedback can be provided through sound, color, text etc.
- **Feeling of control** – users want and should be able to control the device – users often try to control the device depending on the mental model that they have created. 
- **Interaction** – continuing cycle of action and reaction (e.g. between humans and devices)
- **Mental model** – the concept of how the device works that user creates in his own mind (it does not have to - and often doesn’t – reflect the reality); “Great devices work as expected”
- **Persona** – a tools that helps to focus on the needs of users – basically a description of typical user with the context and needs
- **Relation** – special or logical connection between elements – e.g. labels should be places on or next to controls that they refer to so it is easy to recognize their function
- **User** Centered Design – the design methodology that stresses the role of the user in the design process – the product should be tested as soon as possible and challenged by real users 

 
## The task

Your task will be to design the prototype of new and innovative thermostat.
 
### Assumptions:

The thermostat is the only tool for adjusting the temperature in the whole room (no need to adjust single radiator).

The thermostat should inform the user about current temperature in the room and the temperature that is programmed as target temperature (the temperature that thermostat tries to achieve).

User should be able to program the temperature for specific hours and days of week. (e.g. after 23.00 on Monday to Friday, whole Saturday). System should allow setting up at least 5 programmes.

Thermostat should inform about current energy consumption level (low, medium, high).

User should be able to adjust the temperature right now (thus overwriting current program).

User should be able to switch thermostat to “out of home” state (minimal energy consumption).

User should be able to switch off the thermostat. 

 
### Solution

Use materials provided to design the mock-up (prototype) of the device. Work in teams of 2 or 3.

You can use shapes that are prepared on the station or cut out/draw your own shapes. If possible prepare a few (4-6) mock-ups showing different states that will allow to “tell the story” and will help you to simulate and to describe the behavior of the device.

Think about controls for input (e.g. changing the temperature, creating new program, choosing the day of the week) as well as a way of providing feedback (e.g. current temperature, program set etc.).

You have about 45 minutes to prepare the prototype and brief presentation.
 
### Tips

Decide if you want to use touch screen, physical controls or both.

Think about priorities – what is the most important information to display and what is the most common action? Make important information and controls bigger and easier to access and ones that will be accessed less often smaller or less exposed (hidden?).

Try to use familiar design patterns (typical solution that is familiar to users – e.g. switch control to allow turning the device on and off).

Think about other tools that serve similar function or solve similar problems (e.g. alarm clock, radio, washing machine, light controls). Maybe they can be used as metaphors or inspiration.  

Think of representative scenarios for using your device. Try to think about its design not in terms of device's function alone ("it should allow me to set temperature for the future") but specific user's need ("I am going out of city for a weekend and I don't need heating.").

Try to think about workarounds, that people use to utilize a function, that is unavailable through current device (thermostats) - for example, setting a reminder on one's mobile phone to switch off thermostat before going for vacations.


### Presentation of the solution

Each team will be asked to prepare a short presentation of their mockup. The presentation should take no more than 3 to 5 minutes. It should include presentation of the general concept as well as description of how device allows to:

- inform about current temperature in the room,
- inform about the temperature that is programmed as target temperature,
- program the temperature for specific hours and days of week. (e.g. after 23.00 on Monday to Friday, whole Saturday). System should allow setting up at least 5 programmes,
- adjust the temperature right now (thus overwriting current program),
- switch to “out of home” state.

## Additional tasks

### Find online user manuals of 5 different programmable thermostats

Read the programming instruction and try to understand the process and the rules. How the designers solves problems defined in this workshop? Think about the different ways the same problem is solved. 

Which one is better and why?

### Analyze the interface of your washing machine

How do you pick the right programme (temperature, type of fabric and length washing) and make sure it is the right one? 

Repeat the process from the workshop to create better washing machine interface. List typical user’s tasks (what would you like to do when you start washing). Design control panel and feedback (display, light, sound). Try to minimize the cognitive effort of the user (so they do not need to remember the right setting).
