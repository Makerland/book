>Did you ever want to create something out of nothing? To create your own 3D designs or to easily customize the ones made by others. Seek no further, we will guide you through your first steps in 3D modeling. We will show you the basics and some cool tricks so you can start designing your FUTURE! Only thing you need is a laptop with webgl browser and some positive vibe. Be there or be square :)

# 3D Modeling

## Overview
During this workshop you will learn how to use Tinkercad to create & customize 3D models. 

[Tinkercad](https://tinkercad.com/) is an easy-to-use tool for creating digital designs that are ready to be 3D printed into physical objects.

And at the end you will have a task to make an object that you can print later on one of our 3D printers

## Preparations

- We will be using browser based software so you don't have to install anything!
- All you need to do is to go to <https://tinkercad.com/> & register for a free account. 
- Later on we will also be using Google Docs drawing tool (<https://docs.google.com/drawings>), so if you don't have a Google account this is a good time to go and get one.

## Main flow

### Learn the layout
Log in to your Tinkercad account, click on Create new design button & let's get started! 

Take some time to know your way around Tinkercads layout. Basically all the tools you will need are located in the right menu bar. 

### Check your grid
Near the bottom right corner of the workplane you have *Edit grid* options & *Snap grid* value. 

Leave the value as it is, but we need to adjust the grid size to those of the 3D printer bed. It will be easier for you to understand the dimensions you are working in.

### Learn the basics
Drag the red Box to the workplane (close to middle is usually best).

You can drag the box to any place on the workplane. Click & drag to move it in x & y axis, pull the black arrowhead on the top plane to move it in the "z" axis.

Click on the Box and play with the visible controls. 

Black dots on the base of the box allow you to scale the box in "y" or "x" axis, and the white dot on the top plane lets you scale it in the "z" axis. 

You can also scale the box freely in x&y axis while pulling one of four white dots on the base plane. Use uniform scaling of the objects just by holding shift while pulling any of the control dots.

Notice that you can also rotate the objects in any direction. Holding Shift button while doing so will snap the rotation every 45 degrees.

### Working with dimensions
First of all delete the object you were working on before.

Ok, now get *Cylinder* on the plane.
Now from the right menu bar choose the *Ruler* and put it on the workplane.

Notice that when you click on the cylinder now, when the ruler is also on the workplane, you can see the dimensions of the object. You can click on them to enter values.

Change the dimensions to:

- height: 15mm
- diameter: 25mm.

Apart from the object dimensions, you can also change the distance from the workplane & distance from the ruler axis. 

### 3D modelling: the basics
Ok, so we have a cylinder with the dimensions set in the previous step. Now lets get one more cylinder to the workplane. 

1. Set the cylinder dimensions to 

- height: 30mm 
- diameter: 5mm. 

2. Select both objects either by dragging a window over them, or by shift clicking both of them. Go to *Adjust* in the top bar on the right, and choose *Align* option.

3. Center align the cylinders in all three dimensions.

4. Copy & paste the thin cylinder and again select all object and center align them in all dimensions. Rotate one of the thin cylinders 90 degrees.

5. Select the horizontal thin cylinder and the big one and group them together using either keyboard shortcut or command from the top menu bar. 

> Group command in Tinkercad welds the objects together, you can unweld them simply by ungrouping them.

6. Change the color of the grouped object.

7. Change the diameter of the thin vertical to 20mm. Realign the objects.

8. Click on the thin cylinder and set it to Hole in the inspector. 

9. Group all objects together and congrats you have your first 3D model ready!

### Use the basic modeling techniques you learned to create a gaming dice
Use the predefined dice model from the right menu bar & the numbers also found there. Feel free to experiment.

## Additional tasks
Do you feel good with your skills? If so let’s get to the next step if not keep on experimenting or ask us for some help.

### Utilize your 3D modelling skills to make something useful
We dare you to design and model a bottle opener and since the material we will be printing with is not so strong, we will be using a coin in the design, so it will be more sturdy and open the bottle instead of breaking ;)

### 1.1. Using Google Docs drawing tool to make custom shapes & text.

Go to <https://docs.google.com/drawings> to start a new drawing.

Here you can create custom shapes with curve tools or use some predefined shapes that are still much more than the ones in Tinkercad or even create custom text! 

When you have your shape or text ready, go to *File* -> *Download as* -> *.svg*
You can now import this file to Tinkercad using the *Import* command at the top of the right menu bar.

### 1.2. Tips for designing the bottle opener.

You can visit <http://www.thingiverse.com/> and search for some bottle openers to have some inspiration of what you can do. If you don’t have the patience you can even download the opener you really like and personalize it.

You should know the dimensions of the coin you will be using in your design - you can use the web to find them or use our calliper to measure it.

Your design should not be bigger than x=60mm, y=60mm, z=30mm - printing takes some time and everyone would like their design to be printed :)
