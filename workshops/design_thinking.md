# Thermostat easy as pie
# - designing physical interfaces 
 
## Overview
 
Most of contemporary technology depends on interaction with people. The key element of successful devices is the way they meet needs of users. That means they should do something users need and do it in a way that is easy to understand and learn.
 
That’s where interaction design comes in. The process and tools for creating interactions and interfaces that are easy to use and that empowers users and make them happy.
    
We will try to learn the basics and a little bit more of interaction design approach. The example that is going to be used will be a thermostat. This kind of devices are often too complex and designed in a way that requires too much effort to learn. But the example of innovative Nest thermostat shows that it might be done in a simpler way.
 
## Buttons and minds – brief introduction to interaction design
 
There are three main areas that should be taken into consideration when designing the device (interface, service, almost anything):
 
Users – Who is going to use the device?
 
(Is it a man, women or a child? How old is he or she? Is he or she familiar with technology? Motivated?)
  
Tasks (and needs) - Why is the device being used?
 
(Is it for fun or work? What kind of goal is user going to accomplish? Why? Is the task complex? Repetitive? Important?)
 
Context (and situation) – When and where does the interaction take place?
 
(When the device is going to be used – inside or outside? Is the situation stressful? Is the device connected? What are the default parameters? Will user wear gloves? Is there a lot of sun? Is it noisy?)
  
The basic concepts that should be with us during whole workshop are the following:
 
- **Affordance** – as Wikipedia puts it “is a quality of an object, or an environment, which allows an individual to perform an action” – in other words, the shape, behavior or other feature that suggests how the element should be used e.g. physical button by its shape suggest pressing
- **Control** – the way the devices state or parameter can be changed – control allows user to operate the device – it can be button, touch panel, knob, switch etc. 
- **Ergonomy** – all the efforts and approach “intended to maximize productivity by reducing operator fatigue and discomfort” i.e. how to adjust technology to our mental and physical capability 
- **Feedback** – information about what is happening or what are the consequences of performed action - all interactions should generate some feedback – turning device on/off, changing it’s state, changing parameters of the device etc. Feedback can be provided through sound, colour, text etc. 
- **Feeling of control** – user want and should be able to control the device – user often try to control the device based on the mental model that they have created. 
- **Interaction** – continuing cycle of action and reaction (e.g. between humans and devices) 
- **Mental model** – the concept of how the device works that user creates in his own mind (it does not have to - and often doesn’t – reflect the reality); “Great devices work as expected” 
- **Relation** – special or logical connection between elements – e.g. labels should be places on or next to controls that they refer to so it is easy to recognize their function
- **User** Centered Design – the design methodology that stresses the role of the user in the design process – the product should be tested as soon as possible and challenged by real users 
- **Persona** – a tools that helps to focus on the needs of users – basically a description of typical user with the context and needs
 
## The task

Your task will be to design the prototype of new and innovative thermostat.
 
### Assumptions:

The thermostat is the only tool for adjusting the temperature in the whole room (no need to adjust single radiator).

The thermostat should inform the user about current temperature in the room and the temperature that is programmed as target temperature (the temperature that thermostat tries to achieve).

User should be able to program the temperature for specific hours and days of week. (e.g. after 23.00 on Monday to Friday, whole Saturday) and possibly to use weather reports to adjust the temperature (e.g. if the temperature outside is over 18 degrees, switch heating off).

User should be able to adjust the temperature right now (thus overwriting current program).

User should be able to switch thermostat to “out of home” state.
 
### Solving a problem

Use materials provided to design the mock-up (prototype) of the device. Work in teams of 2 or 3.

You can use shapes that are prepared on the station or cut out your own shapes. If possible prepare a few (4-6) mock-up showing different states that will allow to “tell the story” and will help you to simulate and to describe the behavior of the device.

Think about controls for input (e.g. changing the temperature, creating new program, choosing the day of the week) as well as a way of providing feedback (e.g. current temperature, program set etc.).

You have about 30 minutes to prepare the prototype and brief presentation.
 
### Presentation of the solution

Each team will be asked to prepare a short presentation of their mockup. The presentation should take no more than 3 to 5 minutes. It should include presentation of the general concept as well as description of how device allows to:

- inform about current temperature in the room
- inform about the temperature that is programmed as target temperature
- program the temperature for specific hours and days of week. (e.g. after 23.00 on Monday to Friday, Whole Saturday) and possibly to use weather reports to adjust the temperature (e.g. if the temperature outside is over 18 degrees, switch heating off).
- adjust the temperature right now (thus overwriting current program).
- switch to “out of home” state.
