# Introduction

Dear Reader,

Welcome to the first edition of Makerland Tutorials: Your First Steps with the Internet of Things. You're looking at the open source book for experimental conference - Makerland 2014. We created this book to help our conference attendees successfully go through the workshops presented at Makerlan. We felt it's really wrong that only 300 people can use this resources to start their own journey with the Internet of Things, Arduino, 3D printing and more.

This book is not meant to be readed in the armchair, with a cup of latte, it's rather a hands on dive into world of Internet of Things. Each chapter is prepared by someone else, so you may notice a difference in style or formatting. We asked all of Makerland workshop leaders to prepare a tutorial for their workshop station and then we put it all together as a book.

At the beginning of each chapter, you'll find a list of things you need to have in order to accomplish the goal. Tutorials are structured as a step by step instructions. Most of them required some programming knowledge, but if you know nothing about coding, this book is going to teach you something about that too.

If you have any problem with a particular step in this book, please go here and open an issue: 
<https://github.com/Makerland/book/issues>. We would love to help and improve this book with you.

## Who made this?

Our wonderful workshop leaders spent a lot of time and put a lot of effort to make those tutorials. All of them are amazing experts on what they do and have a great passion to teach people about hardware.
