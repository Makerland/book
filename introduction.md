## Introduction

You're looking at the open source book for experimental conference - Makerland 2014. We gathered most of the knowledge you may need to successfully go through the workshops. This book is not meant to be readed in the armchair, with a cup of latte, it's rather a hands on dive into world of Internet of Things.

It contains workshops tutorials and some additional information that you might find very useful. Not every workshop has it's "full" tutorial. When it comes to 3D printing - there is just too much little differences between 3D printers usage across models and brands that it just did not make sense. You'll find a lot of helpful people at the stations though so we made sure you're not going to get lost.

## Workshops

Workshops are essential part of Makerland. During the first two days of the conference, you will spend 5 hours each day learning everything you're interested in. More importantly, you'll have a chance to actually build something. Workshops are very practical, hands on approach, ~one hour long sessions provided in very small groups, without fixed schedule. It's not a class: you can do things on your own terms and time, workshops are asynchronous and tailored for everyone. We sometimes call workshops "stations" because of their asynchronous character.

On each workshop station you’ll get a TUTORIAL, that will explain you in very simple steps how to create something. Of course, workshop leaders will be there all the time to get you excited, help you, explain further and answer all of your curious questions :) 

We did the same thing during our Makerland alpha test in November, but back then we just printed some instructions on a loose paper. The result was quite messy: some pages were lost, some were destroyed, and you had to be careful not to lose them.

That’s how the idea of printing a real book came across our minds. Every Makerland attendee got a book containing more than 170 pages of tutorials, cheat sheets, instructions and awesome knowledge prepared by your workshop leaders. The book will guide you through the hardware world and be your handbook whenever you’re in doubt. The book will also be available online in form of PDF and website, so you don’t have to carry a book if you don’t want to.

20 workshops is a lot to process in just two days, so we don’t expect you to attend every each of them. That’s why the book would be also helpful if you want to try do to something yourself after Makerland: no need to google anything or looking for resources. This way you won’t leave Makerland alone :)

## Who did this?

Our wonderful workshop leaders spent a lot of time and put a lot of effort to make those tutorials. It may look easy, but it's a a lot of hard work, iterating over problems, re-testing the workshop. This book is work of theirs. Make sure to give them a hug whenever you will see them.

__Miłosz, Justyna, Pawel, Wojtek, Mateusz, Szymon, Swift, Martin, Andrew, Felix, Robin, Jon, Karolina, Alan, Hubert, Simon, Krzysztof, Charalompos, Jason and Stephen__: we cannot thank you enough for your work, patience and understanding. This book could never happen without your amazing support.
